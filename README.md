# flexbox-practice-website
This website was created to display a cinema's showtimes. The primary goal of the project was to practice using Flexbox and develop a fully responsive layout. It adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring that users can easily navigate and view the showtimes on both desktop and mobile devices.
